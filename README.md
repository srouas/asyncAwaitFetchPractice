# Async / Await and Fetch practice

Practicing my newly learnt async await and fetch API knowledge in a task given by SOC

### Task

- Fetch data from https://api.kanye.rest/ containing a quote and then on the given website have it set to the h1 of the page and on click of the button to give you a new quote, aka a new header each time.

### Reflections

- Remember to store everything in a variable to make it easy to access!
- Remember with objects to access using dot notation!
- Break it down into a plan without using code in the beginning, it will make it easier to see later on what's the right code to use.
- Always await when using an async function, otherwise you will just return an unresolved promise
